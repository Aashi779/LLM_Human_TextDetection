        "The objective of this notebook is to participate in 'LLM : Detect AI generated text' competition where using a dataset of prompts and texts generated by humans and AI, we have to predict which one is generated by an AI. First, we use different datasets and combine them to prepare a dataset which has classes balanced. then , we clean tha data by stemming(a text processing method that removes prefixes and suffixes from words to transform them into their root form.) the text, removing stopwords and punctuations. After this, we convert text into numbers by Count Vectorizer and then finally we train an ML model on the final vector and test it on validation dataset before predicting the results of test dataset. The results on using different ML models is documented in last cell.\n",
